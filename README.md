As mentioned in this course's syllabus, I took the liberty of using platforms outside the classroom. Specifically, StackOverflow, youtube guides, and ChatGPT. Although the entirety of my code is not based upon these sources alone, it is stated in the syllabus to mention anywhere AI was applied. I had difficulty understanding how to develop a RESTful JWKS endpoint that serves the public keys in JWKS format and prompted AI for assistance. The rest of the code was sourced from online guides and Stackoverflow. I also used ChatGPT to generate typical tests for the test suite as I did not know many possible scenarios to test for. At the end, I ran all four programs (the three tests and the server) through GPT-3.5 to locate any syntax errors.
